## Synopsis

The goal is to create a repository with well-formatted, print-friendly cheatsheets for React Native. There are things that are commonly used in everyday development, yet are forgotten even more often. Best practices that you want to share with everyone. Things you want everyone in your team to know. This is the place to share all of that.

I will be making most of the cheatsheets in [draw.io](http://draw.io/), and you can find both a .pdf file and the source .xml file. I hope everyone who wants to contribute will follow the same convention (or suggest to improve it).

## Cheatsheets List

* [React Native Lifecycle Handles](./Lifecycle)


## Contributors

If you want to contribute in creating a great RN cheatsheet database, feel free to make a pull request. Make sure that the cheatsheet is easy to read (even from some distance), easy to understand, and print-friendly.
